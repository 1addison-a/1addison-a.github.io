        <p><b>Overall, this page is well put together and very professional, following CRAP principles. It effectively uses JavaScript to manipulate the content on the page through the HTMLInclude.js component system. The navigation bar button indicates which page you are currently on, which enhances the user experience as visitors move between R programming lessons. The home page provides a clear introduction to the site's purpose and learning objectives, with well-organized sections that outline what learners can expect. The R logo image adds visual interest and reinforces the site's focus. The footer is also well formatted, providing information about the site's history, quick links to all lessons, and contact information. </b>
